                            Walk the streets of old Yangon to see leafy lanes and byways
                            filled with enormous timber mansions decorated in the unique
                            Myanmar style, where British captains of industry once lived.
                            See century-old buildings with magnificent architecture, which
                            act as reminders of Yangon’s past. The number of colonial
                            buildings still standing in downtown Yangon is nothing short of
                            spectacular. Myanmar’s isolation from the rest of the world
                            during the years after independence resulted in a level of
                            preservation that is unique in the region. It is heartening to
                            see that at last, some of them are being restored to their
                            former beauty. Yangon’s colonial streets are a showcase of the
                            best, or most ostentatious, of colonial architecture an
                            exuberant display of wealth and designer dexterity.

                            the cultural centre of Myanmar and was the last royal capital.
                            Surrounded by other ancient royal capitals, including Sagaing,
                            Ava (Inwa) and Amarapura, Mandalay also acts as a base for
                            sightseeing trips to these places of significance. In Mandalay,
                            visitors can watch traditional handicrafts being made, such as
                            kalaga tapestries, marionettes, bronze items and stone and wood
                            carvings. Mandalay also houses the most revered Buddha statue in
                            the country, the Maha Myat Muni image. The Buddha himself is
                            said to have breathed on to the just-finished image, giving it
                            some of the Buddha’s power.
